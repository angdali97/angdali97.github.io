I am a fifth-year Ph.D student in Economics at Texas A&M University. My research is in econometrics, where I develop theoretical methods to improve empirical analysis, with interests in measurement error models, factor models, and nonparametric kernel methods.



I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market.
